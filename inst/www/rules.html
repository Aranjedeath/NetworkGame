<p>You have been selected by the President to plan the country's communication network. <i>You must be very smart!</i><p>
<p></p>
<p>As the country grows and new cities are established they will need to be connected to other cities in the country. Each year a new city will be established. You choose the rules that determine how that new city gets wired into the network.</p>
<p>You will select how much influence each of the following has on the design of your network:</p>
<p><i><strong>Chance</strong></i></p>
<p>Should you just roll dice and leave it all to chance? Or should every connection be precisely determined?</p>
<p><i><strong>Popularity</strong></i></p>
<p>Should a new city be connected to a city that already has a lot of connections?</p>
<p><i><strong>Age</strong></i></p>
<p>Should new cities connect to cities that have been around for a long time?</p>
<p>Be careful! These selections matter. After building your network, it will be scored. The more <b>robust</b> the <b>better</b>. You will start: get a message from <b>A</b> to <b>B</b>. Each round a city will shut-down by chance. The another city. And the next. The longer you network can still get from <b>A</b> to <b>B</b>, the higher your score.</p>
<p>Got it?</p>
At the end you will compare you score to everyone else who has designed a similar network.</p>
<p><b>Are you up to the task?</b></p>
